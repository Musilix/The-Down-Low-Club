# The Down Low Club

A travel app that aims to provide people with great recommendations on your travels that avoid the low quality, unenjoyable tourist traps.

## It's no secret

The method in which The Down Low Club finds it's hidden gems is by utlizing resources that are already out there!

Instead of having to scour countless subreddits, comb through a bunch of google reviews, or stoop so low to use Yelp, you can have a go-to app that will give you some authentic, low-key experiences.
